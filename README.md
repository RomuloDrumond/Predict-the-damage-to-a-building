# Overview
This repository contains a quick attempt to build a good predictive model for this competition:  https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/machine-learning/predict-the-energy-used-612632a9-3f496e7f/ 

The analysis was made with python. To install dependencies run `pip install -r requirements.txt` on the main directory.

## Important libraries used:

* Pandas
* Numpy
* Sklearn
* Xgboost
* Keras (Tensorflow-gpu backend)

## Algorithms used:

* k-Nearest Neighboors
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Trees
* Artificial Neural Networks
